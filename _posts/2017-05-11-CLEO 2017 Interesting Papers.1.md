## IMDD
### STu1M.4 IMDD OFDM Transmission over 100 km SSMF using SSB filtering with 2 Silicon MRR
- Mohammed-E. Chaibi et al U of Renners France
- 14.69 Gb/s OFDM
- DML + filter 
- idea is the same as IM + filter to generate SSB, so 2xMRR can be a candidate for filtering

# SiPh
## Freq-Comb
### STh1O.8 0.18dB Ultra-flat Opt Freq Comb Generation using cascaded Mod with low driving RF power
- Xu Xiao, SJTU China
- 15 lines, 0.18 dB spectral power variation
- MZM + PM

### SM4O.6 Flat-top Freq-comb generation with Si MRM and MRR
- X. Wu The Chinese U of HK
- < 0.86 dB intensity deviation
- 10 GHz spacing
- 3.6 Vpp 
- comb generated through phase modulation - near critical coupling
- notch filter to suppress component with higher power - increase IL

## MOD
### ATh3B.8 Ultrahigh ER on-chip AM with broadband operation
- S.Liu Sandia National Lab, USA
- >65 dB ER over 160 nm spectral range
- cascaded MZM employies an additional coupler and extra phase shifter
- 50 dB ER at 4 Gb/s theoretically achievable
- own fab
- comment: trash

### STu1M.3 Phase Drift in Depletion Mode SiP Mod
- J.Lin, Wei Shi and Leslie Rusch at Laval
- modulation induced phase drift in GHz freq - impact on BPSK - constellation distortion
- comments: NL decision boundaries through ML may be applied
