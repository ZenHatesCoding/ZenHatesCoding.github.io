## LiNbO3

[LiNbO3 on SiN - Bowers](https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-42-4-803)

## Light source solution

[QD expitaxially grown on 001 GaP/Si - Bowers](https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-42-2-338)

- Electrically pumped 1.3 um CW up to 90 degree Celcius

## magneto-optic materials

[MR based Isolator and circulator with integrated electromagnet - Bowers](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7815364/)
- Ce:YIG
- 32 dB for isolator, 11 dB for circulator

## nonlinear optics in Si - usually use SiN

[Effect of Muliphoton absorption on parametric comb generation in Si MR - Alex Columbia](https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-40-12-2778)

- parametric oscillation may occur at **MIR** wavelengths, provided that the free-carrier lifetime is sufficiently short or the optical pump power is sufficiently low, 
- inhibited at **telecom** wavelengths. 
- an etchless, air-clad silicon microresonator that enables an octave-spanning frequency comb in a completely **passive** device.
