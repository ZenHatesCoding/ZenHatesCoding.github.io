## NTT's view
- available around 2020
- along with 4G LIE, may goes to stand alone in the future 
 
## Bell Labs (Nokia)
- 4G for current applications: 
    - extreme mobile broadband
    - massive machine communication
    - critical machine communication
- 5G for new applications - embrace new capabilities
    - video/web - LTE
    - VR AR, fixed wireless loop - broad bandwidth
    - IoT (Internet of **Things**)
    - system control - ultra-low latency
- 4 challenges
    - move more completely to a mobile edge compute model with minimal functionality at the access point site
    - lower latency - for 5G applications and the network itself
    - higher data rate in average and in peak
        - peak data throughputs in excess of 1Gbps
        - greater use of MIMO arrays for capacity enhancement
        - no reduction in latency
    - 10x more cell sites
        - to increase capacity
        - mm Wave?
